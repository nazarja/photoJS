# photoJS
A CSS and JS based Image Playground, include basic adjustments, Tranforms, Gradients, Blend Modes and the ability to add and manipulate text.


/********* This Project is only tested for Chrome *********/

Currently I am not using HTML5 Canvas so saving of an Image must be done by the user with a screenshot. Ideally I would love to expend this editor into a more full featured tool, but unnfortuntely I am currently working through freeCodeCamp's course and my time to work on this is limited. If interested, I would love you to fork and make changes improvements or additional features.

Features needed include: CSS masks, SVG Filters, local file upload, and if I made additional images availible for to sake of layers, I would need to be able to control the effects independently on each image. The same would apply to text.
